'''
Given an integer array nums and a value, 
val, remove all instances of val in-place and
return the length of the new array.
Note: It does not matter what values you leave in the array
beyond the arrayâ€™s new length.
Ex: Given the following nums and val...

nums = [1, 2, 3], val = 2, return 2 (after your modifications your array could look like [1, 3, 3]).
