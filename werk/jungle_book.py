'''
There are a number of animal species in the jungle. Each species has one or more predators that may be direct or indirect.
Species X is said to be a predator of species Y if at least one of the following is true:
Species X is a direct predator of species Y. If species X is a direct predator of species Z, and Z is a direct predator of Y,
then species X is an indirect predator of species Y. Indirect predation is transitive through any number of levels.
Each species has a maximum of 1 direct predator. No two species will ever be mutual predators, and no species is a predator of itself. 
Determine the minimum number of groups that must be formed to so that no species is grouped with its predators, direct or indirect.
