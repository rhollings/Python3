Instead of learning solutions of LeetCode questions, understand patterns! ðŸ™‚

For ex.

If input array is sorted then
- Binary search
- Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
- Backtracking

If given a tree then
- DFS
- BFS

If given a graph then
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) 

If given a linked list then
- Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
- Stack

If must solve in-place then
- Swap corresponding values
- Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options then
- Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
- Heap

If asked for common strings then
- Map
- Trie

Else
- Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
- Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
